<h1 class="heading">How To Stay Safe and What To Do</h1>

<h2 class="subheading"> When you're not noticed by him</h2>
<p class="text">When you noticed Oguz Demiralay and managed to stay covert, you have to dial one of the emergency numbers provided on the homepage immediately. Try to protect your distance from him.  </p>
<h2 class="subheading"> When you're seen by him</h2>
<p class="text">If you’re seen by him, and he is far away, you can try to run away but never forget that you can only run in order to get some time. According to records, Oguz Demiralay can catch his preys anyways. He can run as fast a boar, and due to that fact, ordinary people are fucked – excuse my French.  

    If you’re noticed in a relatively short distance, try to distract him by throwing a baby in front of him or feeding him with pocket salami. If this strategy doesn’t work, then declare that you’re Armenian. Oguz Demiralay is allergic to Armenian people. But never say you’re Kurdish or Korean. God forbids. You can also bamboozle him by saying “cücük meat” several times.  </p>
<h2 class="subheading"> When things get physical</h2>
<p class="text">When things get physical, never ever try to wrestle him. Try to relax and not to resist. At this point, your main goal should be to stay alive after the contact. Oguz Demiralay doesn’t like animals with integrity, such as humans and frogs; therefore, take off pants and serve your bottom as a trophy to him. In this way, he may not bite you at all.  </p>
<h2 class="subheading"> After the encounter</h2>
<p class="text">After the encounter, check your body, whether it’s whole or not. Try to stop any bleeding and dial emergency numbers as quickly as possible. To make him believe everything was good, you can light a cigarette or giggle a little bit. This technique can save you from another attack. However, be aware that if you managed to make him believe you’re satisfied, he may come near you and try to cuddle with you. At this point, let him spoon you and not burst into laughter as he will feel like a backpack. Try to relax. Control your breath. Never hyperventilate.</p>
<h2 class="subheading"> To stay safe</h2>
<p class="text"> To stay safe, always have a piece of “cücük meat” rinsed in vinegar. Listen to System of a Down all day long. Carry a “Giancoli Physics for Engineers” textbook as if it’s a holy cross. Never waste any minute outside if it’s unnecessary.  </p>

<h2 id="subheadingg"> Share your experience</h2>
<p class="text">Each year hundreds, if not thousands, of people commit suicide after their encounter with Oguz Demiralay. As a survivor, by sharing your experience you can save people.</p>
